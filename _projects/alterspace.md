description: >-
        <p>A prototype project that gives library patrons control over their space, allowing them to change lights and sounds.</p>
        <p>We deployed Alterspace in three libraries: Cambridge Public Library, Somerville Public Library, and Langdell Hall in Harvard Law School (on two floors).</p>
        <p>This is a collaboration between <a target="_blank" href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu">Library Innovation Lab</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/clare__stanton">Clare Stanton</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andygoddamnedsilva/">Andy Silva</a>, myself) and 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://metalab.github.io">metaLAB</a> (<a href="http://jessyurko.com/#">Jessica Yurkfvsky</a>, <a href="https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/mbattles">Matthew Battles</a>), funded by the <a target="_blank" href="https://knightfoundation.org">Knight Foundation.</a></p>
        <p>Sound artist <a href="https://www.alisa-kolot.com">Alisa Kolot</a> created original music and sourced recordings for this project.
        <p>Designed + built app, deployed on microcontroller (Raspberry Pi).</p>
