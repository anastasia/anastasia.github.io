        <p>I wrote about the experience of having a high-risk pregnancy, being hospitalized, and 
           giving birth in the start of the pandemic.</p>
        <p>The essay was archived by the 
        <a href="https://journals.womenshistory.org/journal/6255682a855347114796b779">National Women's History Museum</a> 
        as part of the Women Writing History: A Coronavirus Journaling Project, and
        excerpted in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/21/arts/design/women-coronavirus-pandemic-journals.html">The New York Times</a>.</p>
        <p>Below is a passage and some handy information if you or a loved one are considering getting pregnant and being hospitalized in the next pandemic.</p>

        <b>Secrets to Passing a Blood Pressure Test The Doctors Don’t Want You to Know About:</b>
        <ul class="antemama">
        <li>1. Eat as many bananas as you can. Every meal — bananas. Dessert? Bananas. Think about how much you love bananas. Consider the banana: what a perfect pandemic fruit, each in its own wrapper. You love bananas. Your loved ones start eating bananas, they’re sending you photos of themselves with solidarity bananas. Come to think of it, you don’t know where you learned that bananas lower blood pressure and it’s too late to start changing your routine. No matter —</li>
        <li>2. Get rest. Not too much, because then your blood pressure can spike for some reason. But if you move before the nurse comes in to check your vitals, even if it’s just to go to the bathroom, you better hope there are at least ten minutes to spare to get into bed, lie still, breathe, and whatever you do, DO NOT THINK ABOUT FAILING A TEST.</li>
        <li>3. Learn to haggle. Is the blood pressure reading bad? Ask for a redo, you weren’t ready. Can you redo now? What about thirty minutes from now? Can the nurse write down only the good reading? Find out later the nurse wrote down all the readings and lied to you about it.</li> 
        <li>4. Do yoga. Become convinced in the magic power of yoga. Do so much yoga you are somehow in the best shape of your life, though you are likely forty pounds heavier than ever before. Are you remembering to rest?</li>
        <li>5. Learn which arm is your good blood pressure arm. There is a difference! I was three quarters into my stay before I learned of my Judas right arm.</li>
        <li>6. Visualize a beach. Realize that each time you think about the beach there are new details. Sometimes you find seashells. Sometimes you hear seagulls. Is that a banana peel in the sand? Go back to step 1.</li>
