    <p>A caselaw timeline, showing cases alongside events to put law decisions into context. This project is still very much a work in progress, and has not been released to the public yet, but here is an <a href="https://case.law/labs/chronolawgic/timeline/EpoLjwiGnw">example</a>.</p>
    <p>I started this project during the last administration after needing to understand how our immigration law is so broken, and also to make sense of my own place in this country as a naturalized immigrant.</p>
    <p>Code and design collaboration with coworker <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andygoddamnedsilva/">Andy Silva</a>. Code: Javascript (VueJS), Python (Django).
