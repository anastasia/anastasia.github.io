    <p>A caselaw timeline, showing cases alongside events to put law decisions into context. This project is still very much a work in progress, and has not been released to the public yet, but here is an <a href="https://case.law/labs/chronolawgic/timeline/EpoLjwiGnw">example</a>.
    Current features working on: importing caselaw directly from casebooks in <a href="opencasebook.org">H2O</a>, a minimap to show a bird's view of the timeline.</p>
    <p>Code and design collaboration with coworker <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andygoddamnedsilva/">Andy Silva</a>. Code: Javascript (VueJS), Python (Django).
