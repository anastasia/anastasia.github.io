    <p>Lots of people pass through <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu">LIL</a>. This was a small sketch to record
    common questions we wanted to ask everyone. Questions like "what does your dream library look like?", and 
    "what's your favorite food for lunch?"</p>
    <p>Just dial a number, hear a pre-recorded question, and answer.</p>
    <p>Project completed, but abandoned before deployment after the realization that sharing a phone between a lot of people is a health hazard (in 2018).</p>
    <p>Continuing work: a Slack bot that allowed for quick listening to previously recorded answers.</p>
