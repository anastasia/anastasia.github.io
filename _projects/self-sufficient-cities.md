        <p>I spent a year working at the <a href="https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Digital Humanities Lab</a> at MIT as a creative technologist. There, I led a group of undergraduates in thinking through and developing various projects, including some preliminary research for Professor Kate Brown's Self-Sufficient Cities.</p>
        <p>We focused on the Deanwood neighborhood in Washington DC. Below are some screenshots from the website which is also viewable through the link above.</p> 
        <p>Through this work, students learned to code (Python, JS), work with maps, and dig into archival material in order to answer difficult questions.</p>
