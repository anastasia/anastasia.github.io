description: >-
    <p>The Wanderverse Project is a collaborative poetry project in MIT's Hayden Library. Each
    co-created poem is called a “wanderverse.” The purpose of this project is to draw the MIT public in
    to explore spaces in Hayden Library they wouldn't otherwise get a chance to visit, and to promote
    stack browsing.</p>
    <p>
    The Wanderverse Project is made with generous support from the <a
    href={"https://arts.mit.edu/camit/"}>Council for the Arts at MIT</a>. This project was born out 
    of a collaboration with Clare Stanton and Andy Silva while at 
    <a href={"https://lil.law.harvard.edu"}>LIL</a>. It was designed and built at MIT's
    <a href={"https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu/"}> Digital Humanities Lab</a> in
    collaboration with Ece Turnator and Mark Szarko of MIT Libraries.
