    <p>A project to show the way that websites change over time, allowing a side-by-side comparison. For this project, I had to read CS research, code a <a href="https://github.com/anastasia/minhash">hashing algorithm</a> from scratch, and <a href="https://github.com/anastasia/htmldiffer">remix another diffing library</a></p>
